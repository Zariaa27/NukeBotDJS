# NukeBot - For educational purposes only.
This bot is **mainly** to train my NodeJS/DiscordJS capabilities. **I do not associate** with anyone who uses this bot **wrongly**

## How to use
The only working cmd is [prefix]ping

To make the bot work, [create an application and bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications), copy it's token and paste it in the config.
In the same **config.json** file as the token, choose your prefix.

## Commands
- [x] Ping command
- [ ] Ban all command
- [ ] Delete all channels cmd
- [ ] Get administrator role
- [ ] Spam channels with custom string (configured in config file)
- [ ] Spam @everyone command

& more to go!
